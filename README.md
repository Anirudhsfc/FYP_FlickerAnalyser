# FYP_FlickerAnalyser

The Mobile light flicker analyzer is a cross-platform mobile application that is used to detect the light flickers in sources of light, example: LEDs and CFLs.

#Database

The database currently requires authentication from the google drive link that can currently be accessed only by the authors. Since there is no publicly available dataset, we have created our own on Google drive.

#Backend

The backend folder contains a .pynb file that can easily be run on online Google colloboratory.  It contains the machine learning algorithm for the project and also contains integration of frontend to the backend using ngrok and fastAPI. 

#Frontend
The frontend folder contains a react native mobile application project that supports both iOS and Android and can be run by installing npm package dependencies  using -
1. npm install in the frontned directory
2. run-android
